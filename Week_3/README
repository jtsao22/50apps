Problem Statement: 

App Category: Text Parsing and 2D Graphics 
DB: None (Use any DB for complex part)

Simple part: 
- Use the Python website that you created in week 2 assignment. 
- Accept a url as input
- Read page content of the url 
- Split the content into words and find out the number of occurences of every word in the page.
- Do not consider the following words: a, an, the, on, in, for, and, to
- Show a simple bar graph on the ui showing the top 10 words with respective count (X axis - words, Y axis - height of
  the bar as per count of word in page) (Do this using HTML5. Add whatever transitions or effects if you want to
  beautify it)
  - Also find out the longest and the shortest word in the page and mention in UI. (Longest and shortest - as per number
    of characters in a word)
  ONE BIG CONDITION - YOU CANNOT USE ANY LOOPING CONSTRUCTS LIKE FOR AND WHILE. (Hint: use map and lambda expressions)
  Try to use map, filter, reduce functionality of Python. Explore use of lambda, pure functions, generators, etc.
